To execute it, you must login with your username (must be sudoer):

### Installation

This Ubuntu config is installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal as the main user of this desktop. 
You can install this via the command-line with `wget`. 


```shell
### bash -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jig/myubuntu/feature/modules/install-all.sh -O -)"
bash -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jig/myubuntu/master/install-all.sh -O -)"
